# note-taker

## About

This is a work in progress that I plan to continue working on to perfect, but want to submit what I have for now in order to fulfill course graduation requirements and come back to it once I have enough time to get it right. The purpose of this app is to allow a user to create and save notes to a database for record-keeping. Currently, I am running into hurdles with the Heroku deployment and have work left to do creating routes for GET paths to html files.
